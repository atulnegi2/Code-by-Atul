Insurance price prediction system using tensrorflow

### This model use various variable to predict the value of the insurance of any person ###
1.In this model we use tensorflow to create a regresson model ehich take input and predict the output  
2. Downlaoad the dataset form the kaggle in csv file and preprocess the data before giving to the model
   use features:
      1:Age 2: Children 3: Somking index 4: BMI 5: Gender 
      According to the features the model predict the value of the final output 


### MODEL DETAILS
Use Tensorflow framework to create the regresson model 
we use sequential model and have input layer hidden layer and output layer if 1 output
use data preprocessing techniques using pandas and numpy to reglarize the data to overcome the ovverfitting and underfitting of the model.
